#### let-before-init

The answer to this problem is `ReferenceError`.

1. `let` has block-scope, which means it's only available within the innermost scope.

2. `x` was declared inside `if-block` which replaced the previous `x` variable.

3. However, `x` is only available after the `let` statement. `x` was not initialized yet inside the `if-block` which lead to a ReferenceError.

4. `ReferenceError` is triggered.
